    <h1 class="about">About Us :</h1>
    <p class="para">Thanks for stopping by! <br><br> <b>Giffies</b> is an online store where you can find the best
        gifts for your loved ones which are classified as per your requirement. The products on our site are from
        Amazon. We know that it is hard to find awesome gifts on Amazon that suits your needs best. You spend hours
        to find the best gift but none of them fits your needs. We are here to help you.
        <br><br>
        Our philosophy is simple we only want to display the collest stuff you can find and buy on Amazon. We are
        not interested in spamming any boring or lame products at you- when you visit <b>Giffies</b> you'll only
        see interesting, innovative and often times very odd products.
        <br><br>
        To be honest, Items listed on our site do return a small commission for products referral, however this is
        not a sale motivation for featuring on item. We regularly list products that we receive absolutely no
        compensation for. We do not carry any of the products listed on our site, nor do we directly sell anything.
        <br><br>
        Again thanks for the precious time you spent reading this!!
